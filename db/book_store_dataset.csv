Academy of Parish Clergy Reference Book of the Year
IVP Readers' Choice Award
A New Testament in English by Native North Americans for Native North Americans and All English-Speaking Peoples
Many First Nations tribes communicate with the cultural and linguistic thought patterns found in their original tongues. The First Nations Version (FNV) recounts the Creator's Story‚Äîthe Christian Scriptures‚Äîfollowing the tradition of Native storytellers' oral cultures. This way of speaking, with its simple yet profound beauty and rich cultural idioms, still resonates in the hearts of First Nations people.
The FNV is a dynamic equivalence translation of the New Testament that captures the simplicity, clarity, and beauty of Native storytellers in English, while remaining faithful to the original language of the Bible. The culmination of a rigorous five-year translation process, this new Bible translation is a collaboration between organizations like OneBook and Wycliffe Associates, Indigenous North Americans from over twenty-five different tribes, and a translation council that consisted of twelve Native North American elders, pastors, young adults, and men and women from different tribes and diverse geographic locations. Whether you are Native or not, you will experience the Scriptures in a fresh and new way.
Read these sample passages to get a taste of what you'll find inside:
""The Great Spirit loves this world of human beings so deeply he gave us his Son‚Äîthe only Son who fully represents him. All who trust in him and his way will not come to a bad end, but will have the life of the world to come that never fades‚Äîfull of beauty and harmony. Creator did not send his Son to decide against the people of this world, but to set them free from the worthless ways of the world."" John 3:16-17
""Love is patient and kind. Love is never jealous. It does not brag or boast. It is not puffed up or big-headed. Love does not act in shameful ways, nor does it care only about itself. It is not hot-headed, nor does it keep track of wrongs done to it. Love is not happy with lies and injustice, but truth makes its heart glad. Love keeps walking even when carrying a heavy load. Love keeps trusting, never loses hope, and stands firm in hard times. The road of love has no end."" 1 Corinthians 13:4-8","The First Nations Version (FNV) Translation Council consists of twelve First Nations individuals representing a cross-section of Native North Americans‚Äîelders, pastors, young adults, and men and women from differing tribes and diverse geographic locations. This council also represents a diversity of church and denominational traditions to minimize bias. The council determined the style and method of translation to be used and continues to be involved in ongoing translation, review, and cultural consultation.

Suddenly, you feel powerless to calm life's chaos. It's all too much to take on by yourself. But pastor and bestselling author Max Lucado has great news for you--Help Is Here.
Now more than ever, we're all weary from the loads we carry and the challenges we face. We have questions we cannot answer and problems we cannot solve. We'd hoped that life would be an invigorating adventure or an inspiring journey. We never expected to grow so tired so quickly. But Max teaches us that we can find fresh strength and purpose in the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Bible makes more than a hundred references to the Holy Spirit, and Jesus says more about the Spirit than he does about the church, marriage, finances, and the future. But do we really know the Spirit? In Help Is Here, Max will give you the tools and encouragement you need to:
Learn who the Spirit is and how the Spirit can help
Become joyful, enthusiastic, and empowered as you draw closer to God
Confidently take on any difficulty with the power of the Spirit
Discover your unique gifts and purpose to further God's kingdom
Help Is Here reminds us that our Good Shepherd doesn't just feed us; he leads us. He does more than correct us; he directs us. God keeps us on track--and best of all, he's commissioned the Holy Spirit to guide us down the winding roads of life, wherever they may lead us.
No more walking this path alone. No more carrying weight you were not intended to bear. It's time for you to enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit and experience the vigorous life he offers. You can rest easy knowing that Help Is Here.","Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

Can it really be God‚Äôs will that His children be silent at a time like this? Decrying the cowardice that masquerades as godly meekness, Eric Metaxas summons the Church to battle.
The author of a bestselling biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Metaxas reveals the haunting similarities between today‚Äôs American Church and the German Church of the 1930s. Echoing the German martyr‚Äôs prophetic call, he exhorts his fellow Christians to repent of their silence in the face of evil.
An attenuated and unbiblical ‚Äúfaith‚Äù based on what Bonhoeffer called ‚Äúcheap grace‚Äù has sapped the spiritual vitality of millions of Americans. Paying lip service to an insipid ‚Äúevangelism,‚Äù they shrink from combating the evils of our time. Metaxas refutes the pernicious lie that fighting evil politicizes Christianity. As Bonhoeffer and other heroes of the faith insisted, the Church has an irreplaceable role in the culture of a nation. It is our duty to fight the powers of darkness, especially on behalf of the weak and vulnerable.
Silence is not an option. God calls us to defend the unborn, to confront the lies of cultural Marxism, and to battle the globalist tyranny that crushes human freedom. Confident that this is His fight, the Church must overcome fear and enter the fray, armed with the spiritual weapons of prayer, self-sacrifice, and love.","ERIC METAXAS is an author whose books have been translated into twenty-five languages. The host of a nationally syndicated radio show and the acclaimed conversation series Socrates in the City, he is a prominent cultural commentator whose work has appeared in the New York Times, the New Yorker, The Atlantic, and the Wall Street Journal.

55,Counterfeit Kingdom,R Douglas Geivett,Religion,"Is there a new reformation happening in the church? It depends on who you ask.
The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is a popular and fast-growing new movement of Christians who emphasize signs and wonders, and teach that God is giving new revelation through new apostles and prophets. But is this biblical Christianity?
In Counterfeit Kingdom, apologists and NAR experts Holly Pivec and Douglas Geivett show how the NAR‚Äôs key tenets distort the gospel, twist the Scriptures, are influenced by New Age practices, and lead faithful Christians to shipwreck their faith. They also offer practical suggestions for readers who are already influenced by the NAR, curious about it, or concerned about loved ones who have been swept up in the movement.
What used to be on the fringes of the church is now mainstream, and many are being influenced by it unaware. This book is a wake-up call.","Holly Pivec is a blogger, author, and speaker, as well as a pastor‚Äôs wife and homeschooling mom.

Bestselling author John Burke is no exception. In Imagine Heaven, he compares more than one hundred gripping stories of near-death experiences (NDEs) to what Scripture says about our biggest questions of Heaven: Will I be myself? Will I see friends and loved ones? What will Heaven look like? What is God like? What will we do forever? What about children and pets?Burke shows how the common experiences shared by thousands of near-death survivors--including doctors, college professors, bank presidents, people of all ages and cultures, and even blind people--point to the exhilarating picture of Heaven promised in the Bible.This thrilling journey into the afterlife will make you feel like you've been there, forever changing the way you view the life to come--and the way you live your life today. You'll discover Heaven is even more amazing than you've ever imagined.'Burke has managed to write this book like a detective novel--it's very hard to put down, yet filled with important content that answers the questions a typical person would have with this subject.

We both independently reached the conclusion that Imagine Heaven is in the top two or three books we have ever read on the subject.

Burke has managed to write this book like a detective novel--it's very hard to put the book down--yet fill it with important content that answers the questions a typical person would have on this subject.

He then shows how this picture should significantly impact the way we live our lives today. As a scientist, I particularly appreciated John Burke's careful analysis of the significant amount of raw 'data' from NDE interviews with people of very different ages, cultures, religious beliefs, and physical challenges (such as blindness) to find the common elements that emerge to give a vibrant picture of what life after death will likely entail.'Walter Bradley, PhD, materials science; author of The Mystery of Life's Origins'Imagine Heaven is a comprehensive compilation of inspiring life-after-death experiences--grounded in the author's solid Bible teaching.

‚ÄúAs someone all too familiar with ‚Äòhurry sickness,‚Äô I desperately needed this book.‚Äù‚ÄîScott Harrison, New York Times best-selling author of Thirst
‚ÄúWho am I becoming?‚Äù
That was the question nagging pastor and author John Mark Comer. Outwardly, he appeared successful. But inwardly, things weren‚Äôt pretty. So he turned to a trusted mentor for guidance and heard these words:
‚ÄúRuthlessly eliminate hurry from your life. Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life.‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt the response he expected, but it was‚Äîand continues to be‚Äîthe answer he needs. Too often we treat the symptoms of toxicity in our modern world instead of trying to pinpoint the cause. A growing number of voices are pointing at hurry, or busyness, as a root of much evil.

91,Is The End Near?,Michael Youssef,Religion,"When will the insanity end?
This book will answer your questions about end times issues by examining statements that Jesus Himself made about what was to come. You will be encouraged as you anticipate Christ‚Äôs return.
Both inside and outside the church, people are asking the same question: Is this the end of the world? With a global pandemic that has killed millions; nations spending millions of dollars to update their nuclear weapons arsenals; and an increase in fire, floods, plagues, and other natural disasters, Christians and non-Christians alike are concluding that history appears to be drawing to a close.
Yet Dr. Michael Youssef says now is not the time to fear. In Is The End Near? Dr. Youssef looks at Jesus‚Äô words in Matthew 24 and 25 about the end of civilization and the coming of the one world ruler and examines:
Whether the ‚Äúbirth pains‚Äù Jesus predicted in Matthew 24 are signs that the end times are near
Evidence for potentially apocalyptic events such as asteroid or comet collisions with earth‚Äîevents that could trigger unprecedented tsunamis and global darkness
Whether it‚Äôs possible for Christians to be deceived by the Antichrist and other false messiahs in the end times
The four dimensions of the coming judgment
How to live in the hope and security of the Lord‚Äôs return, even as the world is collapsing around us
As believers, we don‚Äôt have to fear the end. Using God‚Äôs Word as our guide, we can look toward the future with hope, because we know the One who holds the future in His hands.

1807
When a baby is discovered floating in a basket along the quiet canals of Venice, a guild of artisans takes him in and raises him as a son, skilled in each of their trades. Although the boy, Sebastien Trovato, has wrestled with questions of his origins, it isn't until a woman washes ashore on his lagoon island that answers begin to emerge. In hunting down his story, Sebastien must make a choice that could alter not just his own future, but also that of the beloved floating city.
1904
Daniel Goodman is given a fresh start in life as the century turns. Hoping to redeem a past laden with regrets, he is sent on an assignment from California to Venice to procure and translate a rare book.

93,Bonhoeffer,Eric Metaxas,Religion,"Who better to face the greatest evil of the 20th century than a humble man of faith?
As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and author.
In this New York Times bestselling biography, Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life--the theologian and the spy--and draws them together to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil.
In Bonhoeffer, Metaxas presents the fullest account of Bonhoeffer's life, including his:
heart-wrenching decision to leave the safe haven of America to return to Hitler's Germany
involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in ""Operation 7,"" the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland
lifelong dedication to sharing the tenets of his faith
This edition, revised and with a new introduction from the author, shares the deeply moving story through previously unavailable documents, including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts to reveal never-before-seen dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and work.
Praise for Bonhoeffer:
""Metaxas has created a biography of uncommon power--intelligent, moving, well researched, vividly written, and rich in implication for our own lives. Or to put it another way: Buy this book. Read it. Then buy another copy and give it to a person you love. It's that good."" --Archbishop Charles Chaput, author, First Things

The life, thought, and legacy of C. S. Lewis‚Äîa Prophet for our Times
One of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century, C. S. Lewis bridged literature, philosophy, and religion. He taught at Oxford and Cambridge, all the while communicating in a clear, winsome manner that ordinary men and women could comprehend. He gave us masterpieces like The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, Mere Christianity, The Problem of Pain, and still more. In this fascinating biographical study Not a Tame Lion, author Terry Glaspey points out that Lewis‚Äô life was as compelling as his work. Glaspey gives readers a glimpse of the character of this extraordinarily gifted man‚Äîwho believed that his sharp mind and rich imagination were to be accompanied by a sense of responsibility to the wider world. If Lewis were alive today, he would see the fruition of trends he warned against many years ago. His continued relevance is based on his understanding of the human predicament‚Äîa predicament that is intellectual and moral, as well as spiritual. Lewis points the way out of this predicament, but it‚Äôs not an easy way. It requires submission to God's authority, moral discipline, and integrity of action. Lewis shows how our lives can be lived in light of eternity and can demonstrate the hope that endures, even in these shadowlands.","TERRY GLASPEY is an author, creative mentor, and teaches at Northwind Seminary.

Suddenly, you feel powerless to calm life's chaos. It's all too much to take on by yourself. But pastor and bestselling author Max Lucado has great news for you--Help Is Here.
Now more than ever, we're all weary from the loads we carry and the challenges we face. We have questions we cannot answer and problems we cannot solve. We'd hoped that life would be an invigorating adventure or an inspiring journey. We never expected to grow so tired so quickly. But Max teaches us that we can find fresh strength and purpose in the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Bible makes more than a hundred references to the Holy Spirit, and Jesus says more about the Spirit than he does about the church, marriage, finances, and the future. But do we really know the Spirit? In Help Is Here, Max will give you the tools and encouragement you need to:
Learn who the Spirit is and how the Spirit can help
Become joyful, enthusiastic, and empowered as you draw closer to God
Confidently take on any difficulty with the power of the Spirit
Discover your unique gifts and purpose to further God's kingdom
Help Is Here reminds us that our Good Shepherd doesn't just feed us; he leads us. He does more than correct us; he directs us. God keeps us on track--and best of all, he's commissioned the Holy Spirit to guide us down the winding roads of life, wherever they may lead us.
No more walking this path alone. No more carrying weight you were not intended to bear. It's time for you to enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit and experience the vigorous life he offers. You can rest easy knowing that Help Is Here.","Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

125,Letter to the American Church,Eric Metaxas,Religion,"In an earnest and searing wake-up call, the author of the bestseller Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy warns of the haunting similarities between today‚Äôs American church and the German church of the 1930s. Echoing Bonhoeffer‚Äôs prophetic call, Eric Metaxas exhorts his fellow Christians to repent of their silence in the face of evil before it is too late.
‚ÄúSilence in the face of evil is itself evil.
Not to speak is to speak.
Not to act is to act.
God will not hold us guiltless.‚Äù
Can it really be God‚Äôs will that His children be silent at a time like this? Decrying the cowardice that masquerades as godly meekness, Eric Metaxas summons the Church to battle.
The author of a bestselling biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Metaxas reveals the haunting similarities between today‚Äôs American Church and the German Church of the 1930s. Echoing the German martyr‚Äôs prophetic call, he exhorts his fellow Christians to repent of their silence in the face of evil.
An attenuated and unbiblical ‚Äúfaith‚Äù based on what Bonhoeffer called ‚Äúcheap grace‚Äù has sapped the spiritual vitality of millions of Americans. Paying lip service to an insipid ‚Äúevangelism,‚Äù they shrink from combating the evils of our time. Metaxas refutes the pernicious lie that fighting evil politicizes Christianity. As Bonhoeffer and other heroes of the faith insisted, the Church has an irreplaceable role in the culture of a nation. It is our duty to fight the powers of darkness, especially on behalf of the weak and vulnerable.
Silence is not an option. God calls us to defend the unborn, to confront the lies of cultural Marxism, and to battle the globalist tyranny that crushes human freedom. Confident that this is His fight, the Church must overcome fear and enter the fray, armed with the spiritual weapons of prayer, self-sacrifice, and love.","ERIC METAXAS is an author whose books have been translated into twenty-five languages.

126,Counterfeit Kingdom,R Douglas Geivett,Religion,"Is there a new reformation happening in the church? It depends on who you ask.
The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is a popular and fast-growing new movement of Christians who emphasize signs and wonders, and teach that God is giving new revelation through new apostles and prophets. But is this biblical Christianity?
In Counterfeit Kingdom, apologists and NAR experts Holly Pivec and Douglas Geivett show how the NAR‚Äôs key tenets distort the gospel, twist the Scriptures, are influenced by New Age practices, and lead faithful Christians to shipwreck their faith. They also offer practical suggestions for readers who are already influenced by the NAR, curious about it, or concerned about loved ones who have been swept up in the movement.
What used to be on the fringes of the church is now mainstream, and many are being influenced by it unaware. This book is a wake-up call.","Holly Pivec is a blogger, author, and speaker, as well as a pastor‚Äôs wife and homeschooling mom.

147,My Jesus,Matthew West,Self-Help,"""Whatever you are feeling, God can handle it--all of it. The tears, screams, and questions. God invites you to let Him tend to your heart.""
In the bluegrass fields of Kentucky, Anne Wilson and her siblings, Jacob and Elizabeth, grew up in the security and love of their family--and Jesus. But when Jacob died in a car accident, Anne was thrust into a painful journey of grief and soul-wrestling that led to God calling her to create songs that glorified Him.
My Jesus weaves together Anne's personal story with an encouraging message to anyone longing for God to wipe away their tears.
No matter what season of life you're facing, My Jesus comes alongside you to:
Show how God can bring purpose out of loss
Offer hope in the midst of heartbreak
Remind you that God never abandons you
Discover the beauty that can emerge from suffering as you read Anne's story of growing closer to the God who always makes a way.
Praise for My Jesus:

185,Spiritual Renewal,Andrew Murray,Religion,"The great work of the Holy Spirit is to reveal Christ in our hearts and lives as the crucified one who dwells within us. Let this be the chief aim of all your devotion: complete dependence on God and an expectation of continually receiving all goodness and salvation from Him alone. ‚ÄîAndrew Murray
To live a life of grace filled with God‚Äôs blessings, Christians must set aside time each day to read the Scriptures, spend time alone in prayer, and seek to draw closer to the Lord. In Spiritual Renewal: 90 Devotions for a Deeper Fellowship with God, Andrew Murray provides quiet reflections on the Bible that invite believers to enter into God‚Äôs presence and fellowship with Him daily. Murray shares his heartfelt teachings on:
Fellowshipping with Christ on the cross
The exceeding greatness of God‚Äôs power
How temperance in all things brings us closer to the Lord
The missionary messages of the apostles
The role of the Holy Spirit in the church
Through intimate hours spent with your Savior, you will experience the depths of God‚Äôs abiding presence, the joyful sense of peace that comes from fellowship with our heavenly Father, and the abundant life in Christ that is available to all who seek it.","Andrew Murray (1828‚Äì1917) was an amazingly prolific Christian writer who lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray‚Äôs earliest works were an extension of his pastoral work, written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith. Once books such as Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, and With Christ in the School of Prayer were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness around the world.
He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.
At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.
During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.
Murray‚Äôs writings still move the emotions, search the conscience, and reveal the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.
Countless people have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his devotional books.",208,Whitaker House,Publisher: Whitaker House,17.49,2, French,31-May-22,https://cdn1.bookmanager.com/i/m?b=z5gDKBmobYvXsrjEMrzMSA&cb=1617371235

211,You Are Never Alone,Max Lucado,Edition:,"When life gets difficult, is God paying attention? If I'm facing challenge after challenge, will God help? When my days become dark and stormy, does God notice? The answer in the life-giving stories in the Gospel of John is a resounding yes.
In You Are Never Alone, pastor and New York Times bestselling author Max Lucado reminds us that our miracle-working God sees us, cares about us, and will always come to our aid, no matter what we're up against.
By tracing Jesus' miracles as told in the book of John, You Are Never Alone invites us to take a closer look at the good news John shares with each of us: God is never afraid to meet us in the middle of life's messes, extend a helping hand, and lift us out of our troubles.
You Are Never Alone will equip you to:
Get unstuck and take your first step into a better tomorrow
Dwell in the grace of the cross and the miracle of the empty tomb
Believe that God is your ever-present source of help and hope
Take comfort that you are never without God's protection
You Are Never Alone also includes thoughtful, comprehensive reflection questions designed to go along with each chapter, giving you a chance to dive even deeper into the ways that God walks with you every step of the way.","Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

212,The Vanishing at Castle Moreau,Jaime Jo Wright,Fiction,"A haunting legend. An ominous curse. A search for a secret buried deep within the castle walls.
In 1870, orphaned Daisy Fran√ßois takes a position as housemaid at a Wisconsin castle to escape the horrors of her past life. There she finds a reclusive and eccentric Gothic authoress who hides tales more harrowing than the ones in her novels. As women disappear from the area and the eerie circumstances seem to parallel a local legend, Daisy is thrust into a web that could ultimately steal her sanity, if not her life.
In the present day, Cleo Clemmons is hired by the grandson of an American aristocratic family to help his grandmother face her hoarding in the dilapidated Castle Moreau. But when Cleo uncovers more than just the woman's stash of collectibles, a century-old mystery and the dust of the old castle's curse threaten to rise again . . . this time to leave no one alive to tell the sordid tale.
